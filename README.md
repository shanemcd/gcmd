## Installation

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shanemcd/gdrive-utils.git
cd gdrive-utils

# Run with uv (no installation needed)
uv run gdrive-utils --help
```

## Setup

Before using Drive commands, you need to set up OAuth credentials:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **Google Drive API** and **Google Docs API**
4. Create **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** credentials (Desktop app type)
5. Download the JSON credentials file
6. Save it to `~/.config/gdrive-utils/credentials.json`

On first use, the CLI will open your browser to authenticate. Credentials are cached in `~/.config/gdrive-utils/token.json`.

## Usage

### List and Search Files

```bash
# List recent files (default 20, sorted by modified date)
uv run gdrive-utils list

# List only Google Docs
uv run gdrive-utils list -t docs

# Search for files by name or content
uv run gdrive-utils list -q "project report"

# List with verbose details
uv run gdrive-utils list -v -n 10

# List only folders
uv run gdrive-utils list -t folders
```

### Export Google Doc as Markdown

```bash
# Export to stdout
uv run gdrive-utils export 1abc123xyz

# Export to file
uv run gdrive-utils export 1abc123xyz -o document.md

# Export to directory (uses original filename)

```

# Download to current directory
uv run gdrive-utils download 1abc123xyz

# Download to specific path

```

### Finding File IDs

```
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1abc123xyz/edit
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^
                                   This is the file ID
```
